A Bode plot can be used to visualise how input influences output in terms of magnitude and phase over time. Drawing both the magnitude and phase plots for a transfer function is required when making the Bode plots. The magnitude is shown in decibels (dB), while the phase is shown in degrees. A Bode plot is a graph of a system's frequency response in control Engineering. It is basically a combination of a magnitude plot and a phase plot. By observing the gain margin and phase margin of the Bode plot, the nature of the any given system whether the control system is stable, marginally stable, or unstable based on the values of the following parameters: Gain cross over frequency and phase cross over frequency, Gain margin and phase margin.
