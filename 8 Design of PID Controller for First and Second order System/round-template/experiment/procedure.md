* To obtain the step response of the system, user should apply the general equations of to calculate step response.
* For the calculation of time constant and delay time of step response, the user need to draw the tangent line for the step response obtained from the selected system.

*The simulator will display the overall transfer function. To view the response of the controller, the user need to click the button named show the response of the controller.
