2. The user would identify the poles and zeros present in the chosen transfer function and feed the answers in specific text box given. Then the user will press check answer and display the solutions for checking the entered values are correct. If the answer is correct, the simulation will display ‘Correct’ else the user can click the help button to get the help.

3. The user would enter the values of the poles and zeros present in the chosen transfer function and feed the answers in specific text box given. Then the user will press check answer and display the solutions for checking the entered values are correct. If the answer is correct, the simulation will display ‘Correct’ else the user can click the help button to get the help.

4. The user would calculate asymptotes and meeting points of asymptotes using the formula and feed the answers in specific text box given. The user would calculate break away and break in points using the characteristics equation of the given transfer function. The user would calculate angle of arrival and angle of departure using the formula. The user would calculate root locus crossing point on the imaginary axis using the characteristic equation and equating the differentiation with respect to ‘K’ and equate it to zero. The user would calculate limiting value ‘K’ using the characteristic equation by equating real and imaginary part to zero. Then the user will press Check answer and display the solutions for checking the entered values are correct. If the answer is correct, the simulation will display ‘Correct’ else the user can click the hint/help button to get the formula to be used for calculation.
