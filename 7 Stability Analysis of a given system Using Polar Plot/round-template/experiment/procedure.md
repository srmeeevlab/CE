*The user would calculate the gain and phase angle for the set of frequencies given in the simulator and enter the same in given specific text box. Then the user will press verify and display the solutions for checking the entered values are correct. If the answer is correct, the simulation will display ‘Correct’ else the user can click the hint button to get the help.
