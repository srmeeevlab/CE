The user interacts with the virtual lab through the web page which includes the necessary systems needed for calculations. 

The user is anticipated to have systematic ideas on the equations required for analyzing the step response, time constant and delay time of step response. It is also mandatory for the user to apply those equations for the given system parameters and enter the same for verifying. The result of the calculation would be the step response of the first and second order system. User may also use the help option to have a better clarity on the doubts that arise during the conduction of experiments. Once after completing the time constant and delay time of step responsefor both first and second order system. Also the user checksthe overall transfer function with PID controller for the selected system. The result of the comparison would appear in the output section. This design approach is ideal for estimating the various controller settings that will satisfy the closed-loop system's transient and steady-state requirements.
